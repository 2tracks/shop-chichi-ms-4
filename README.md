## Issues
While working in Gitpod is good it has also a downside, the internet connection 
is not very good where I live. As I performed a git push my Internet connection
got lost and I ended up with the message Master diverged. I could not push up to Github anymore.
I started to search online but there were so many different advices that I diceded to read
the Git docs. I checked the log files for differences - there was only one push.
I could pull the Github repo or do a hard reset but because I've never done it before and I didn't want to lose the histoty
I decided to start a know workspace, installed the requirements.txt, created a new superuser and loaded in the data.
If that wasn't my Milestone Project I probably would have downloaded a .zip from the Repo to have it save and then pulled the repo in.

## Deployment
- Create a new Heroku app - New app - chose closest region
- install pip3 install dj_database_url
- pip3 install psycopg2-binary
- pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
- import dj_database_url in settings.py
- database settings to Heroku url
- Migrate
- create a superuser
- pip3 install gunicorn
- pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
- create Procfile
- heroku login -i
- heroku config:set Disable_COLLECTSTATC=1

## My own thoughts

I was curious about UUID and Slug when to use which one and why, so that's a good chat about it. [UUID or SLUG Chat. ](https://djangochat.com/episodes/urls-slugs-uuids-P9CPo6pA)
I honesly never thought about it - how my Url has to look like and how this could be helpful or a potential security whole.
