## My own thoughts

I was curious about UUID and Slug when to use which one and why, so that's a good chat about it. [UUID or SLUG Chat. ](https://djangochat.com/episodes/urls-slugs-uuids-P9CPo6pA)
I honesly never thought about it - how my Url has to look like and how this could be helpful or a potential security whole.
